# Leveraging AI/Alternative Data Analysis in Sell-Side Research: GOLDMAN SACHS

## Overview and Origin

* Project Name: GS Aggregates Share Tracker
* Project Owner: Jerry, Revich, CFA
* Launch Date: 17 January 2019

* Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research Data Strategy team works directly with both equity and macro research analysts around the globe on projects that require analytical and quantitative skill sets, with the research analysts providing the subject matter expertise and spelling out the investment use cases. Over the past two-plus years, the team (based in New York City and Bengaluru, India) have collaborated on nearly 200 published research analyses across various sectors and markets worldwide. Data sets include app analytics, social media, satellite imagery, government-sourced data, and newspaper articles. Combining these sources with a variety of advanced techniques, such as clustering or sentiment analysis, can create unique investment research insights. One example is “GS Aggregates Share Tracker: Geospatial Assessment Points to Pricing Upside,” published by lead equity analyst Jerry Revich, CFA, on 17 January 2019, which leverages publicly available geospatial data to create local market share estimates and map it to local demographics.

## Business Activities
What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

* The GS Aggregates Share Tracker combines both company data and publicly available quarry data as inputs to the model. It takes advantage of open-source geospatial libraries and leverages the quarry specific metadata to provide estimates of both aggregates production and location information. An iterative validation sequence allows corrections to the raw data, which reduces uncertainties associated with the derived locations. Entity mapping is performed through a combination of NLP and company-reported subsidiary data, in conjunction with the analysts’ domain expertise. Market share calculations are location specific and thus are calculated for each of the roughly 9,000 US quarries at distances from 5 to 50 miles in 5-mile increments.

* The GS Aggregates Share Tracker answers the following questions relevant to a subsector of the materials industry: (1) how to understand positioning in a hyperlocal industry, (2) how to represent market share for public companies in a largely private competitive landscape, and (3) how to inform investment professionals about the directional sense of quarterly company results with respect to aggregate volumes.

## Landscape

* Domain: Investment Management

* Other Major Companies:  Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, Barclays

* Major trends and innovations: The power of the “AI + HI” model: AI techniques can augment human intelligence to enable investment professionals to reach a higher level of performance, freeing them from routine tasks and enabling smarter decision making that leverages the collective intelligence of machines and humans.

* Successful investment firms of the future will be those that strategically plan on incorporating AI and big data techniques into their investment processes. Successful investment professionals will be those who can understand and best exploit the opportunities brought about by these new technologies.

* 3 Types of AI and big data applications in investment management: (1) using natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and voice recognition to efficiently process text, image, and audio data; (2) using machine learning (ML), including deep learning, techniques to improve the effectiveness of algorithms used in investment processes; (3) using AI techniques to process big data, including alternative and unstructured data, for investment insights.

* According to a CFA Institute survey, relatively few investment professionals are currently using AI/big data techniques in their investment processes. Most portfolio managers continue to rely on Excel and desktop market data tools; only 10% of portfolio manager respondents have used AI/ML techniques in the past 12 months. 

* There are five major hurdles to successful adoption of AI and big data in investment processes: cost, talent, technology, leadership vision, and time. Investment firms will need to substantially overcome the five hurdles to reach the top of the FinTech pyramid. 

* Powerful FinTech will be the result of collaboration between Fin (financial institutions) and Tech (technology companies). Successful firms will be centered on T-shaped teams that combine investment expertise, innovation, and technology application across investment strategies or processes.


## Results

* Business impact of the project: In the aggregates industry (the mining of sand, gravel, and crushed rock for use in concrete for the construction industry), volume growth and product pricing margins are two of the most important key performance indicators. 
* The markets themselves are hyperlocal, meaning that market share calculated at the 25-mile range is more accurate than those at the state or even the county level. Identifying where a company’s quarries are located as well as providing a quarry-level estimate of production volume deepen the analyst’s understanding of how a company is positioned (e.g., in which markets a company has pricing power or material exposure). The addition of a new data source that meaningfully tracks company performance with geospatial information provides better insight into how these companies operate.

* Estimating aggregates volumes in this space can inform a company’s strategy: which markets are in focus, how potential M&A activity may change the company’s positioning, and where pricing margins are most important. At its most basic level, the analysis is used to estimate organic growth on a quarterly basis and to provide directional input ahead of earnings. In addition, the analysis is used to understand market share shifts and pricing impact and is levered to estimate company-level exposure weighted by aggregate volumes to weather events, such as regional flooding and hurricanes.

## Recommendations / Key Takeaways

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

* Don’t underestimate the potential of more advanced techniques and approaches for making investment professionals more efficient and thus freeing them up to spend more time on creating better alpha insights! 

* Alternative data does not necessarily translate into an advantage for systematic managers. In fact, we think that more niche, sector-specific data sets lend themselves much better to a fundamental analyst or portfolio manager who digs deeply into specific assets as opposed to an analyst or portfolio manager who covers a much broader range of assets. 

* A single data set or a single methodology has never been the sole driver of a research product. Rather, alternative data adds to the mosaic, but it is not a goal in and of itself. 

* Good research analysts are often aware of data that is relevant to the assets they cover, but they may not know how to best access and/or analyze the data. 

* Leveraging alternative data doesn’t necessarily mean breaking the bank. There is quite a bit of publicly available data that can be additive when properly combined with other data sources that are already been looking into.
